Transcribing and analysing music has never been easier...ðŸ‘Œ

## Summary
Transcribing and analysing is a mandatory for most jazz musicians. Learning and developing sheet music can be a chore and JazzNotes aims to simplify the process,
It allows jazz musicians to take notes from PDFs and images, then they can be annotated, tagged and stored for usage and future reference.

Here's a few of its main features:
- A simple viewer for looking through your sheet music.
- Search transcriptions and notes by tag to find exactly what you're looking for.
- Add titles, notes, tasks, images and tags to each note.
- View a complete task list so you know what's done and what's not.
- An image viewer for zooming into the finer details.
- Keeps a copy of your sheet music, so you don't need to worry about what happens to your PDFs and images.
